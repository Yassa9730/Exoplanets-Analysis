st.markdown("""
This section summarizes key insights and takeaways derived from the exploratory data analysis of our exoplanet dataset.
We reflect on observed patterns, relationships between variables, and interesting anomalies.

st.markdown("""
- **Planet Radius and Orbital Period**:
  - Most planets discovered are small with short orbital periods.
  - Detection bias likely favors planets that are large and close to their stars, especially for transit and radial velocity methods.

- **Discovery Method Patterns**:
  - Transit and radial velocity are the dominant discovery techniques.
  - Transit methods detect more small-radius, short-period planets, while radial velocity finds a broader range.

- **Planet Mass Distribution**:
  - Masses are heavily skewed. A few planets are extremely massive.
  - After applying a log scale, we observe a more normalized distribution with clear outliers.

- **Star Mass vs. Planet Period**:
  - Some correlation is suggested â€” larger stars may have more distant or faster-orbiting planets, but it's not a strong linear trend.

- **Correlations**:
  - **Planet Radius and Mass** show moderate positive correlation.
  - **Orbital Period** correlates weakly with other features, showing its independence.
  - Star properties like mass, radius, and metallicity relate to each other but weakly link to planetary characteristics.

st.subheader("ðŸ“¦ Interpreting the Box Plot of Planet Mass")

st.markdown("""
The box plot in the EDA section visualized the **distribution of planet masses (in Jupiter masses)** using a **log scale**:

- The central box captures the middle 50% of planets â€” the interquartile range.
- The median planet mass is marked by a line within the box.
- Points outside the whiskers represent **outliers** â€” extremely massive planets, some of which may be brown dwarfs or stellar companions.
- Using `log1p` transformation (log of 1 + mass) helped manage skew and made the distribution easier to interpret.

st.subheader("ðŸ”š Conclusion")

st.markdown("""
The EDA phase has provided a clearer understanding of the datasetâ€™s structure, common planetary properties, and how discoveries are shaped by detection methods.
This forms a strong foundation for deeper statistical modeling or predictive analysis.
