# Data Cleaning Verification Report

## Overview
This report documents the data cleaning verification process. The following checks were performed to ensure data quality:

1. **Missing Values Check**
2. **Duplicate Records Check**
3. **Outlier Handling using Winsorization**

---

## 1. Missing Values Check
- The dataset was checked for missing values.
- **Result:** No missing values were found (0 null values).

---

## 2. Duplicate Records Check
- The dataset was checked for duplicate records.
- **Result:** No duplicate records were found (0 duplicates).

---

## 3. Outlier Handling
- The dataset contained a significant number of outliers.
- Instead of removing data points, **Winsorization** was applied to cap extreme values.
- **Capping Strategy:**
  - Applied at the **1st percentile (lower bound)** and **99th percentile (upper bound)**.
- **Visualization:**
  - Box plots were generated before and after applying Winsorization.
  - The range of outliers was successfully reduced while preserving overall data integrity.

---

## Conclusion
The data cleaning process ensured:
- No missing values.
- No duplicate records.
- Effective handling of outliers using Winsorization.

The dataset is now clean and ready for further analysis.
