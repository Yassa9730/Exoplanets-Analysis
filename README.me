Overview
This project investigates the fascinating world of exoplanets using a combination of data science techniques and interactive visualizations. Built as a Streamlit web application, it allows users to explore, visualize, and draw insights from real exoplanet datasets in an intuitive, user-friendly interface.

Streamlit Application
Our Streamlit web app is the core user-facing feature of this project. It enables interactive exploration of the data and includes the following sections:

Pages in the App
Home: Overview of the project, team, and data source.

Exploratory Analysis: Dynamic visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps. Users can filter by discovery year and facility.

Data Cleaning Insights: Summarizes cleaning steps with selectable variable views and explanations of handling techniques.

Facility Finder (Coming Soon): A simple tool to look up discoveries by facility and filter by time period.

Model (On Hold): Planned integration of a predictive model for estimating exoplanet mass or radius.

Technologies Used in the App
Streamlit for the frontend and UI

pandas, numpy for data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for visualization

scikit-learn, scipy for statistical analysis and future modeling

1. Introduction
This report presents an analysis of exoplanetary datasets using data science techniques such as outlier detection, correlation analysis, and visualization. The goal is to derive meaningful insights into planetary characteristics and their relationships with stellar properties.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2.1 Handling Limit-Flagged Values
Identified 35 columns containing limit-flagged values (e.g., <, >, min, max).

Replaced flagged values with NaN to prevent errors in numerical computations.

2.2 Outlier Detection and Handling
Applied Interquartile Range (IQR) method:

Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 √ó IQR

Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 √ó IQR

Additional techniques used:

Modified Z-score

RobustScaler

Winsorization to retain data integrity while handling extreme values.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.1 Correlation Analysis
3.1.1 Star Mass vs. Planet Orbital Period
Spearman‚Äôs œÅ: 0.086

p-value: 4.16e-76

Interpretation: Weak positive correlation. Higher star mass is slightly associated with longer planet orbital periods.

3.1.2 Planet Radius vs. Planet Mass
Spearman‚Äôs œÅ: 0.058

p-value: 9.08e-36

Interpretation: Very weak positive correlation.

3.2 Box Plot Analysis
Outlier distributions were visualized using box plots, confirming the presence of extreme values in planetary mass and radius.

Winsorization was applied to adjust these values without major distortions.

4. Conclusion
This study successfully cleaned and analyzed exoplanet data, ensuring robust numerical accuracy. While certain planetary properties exhibit weak correlations, further studies could integrate additional features and machine learning models to refine predictive capabilities.
